# CodeCheck Tracer Examples
Here's a listing of all CodeCheck Tracer examples I've worked on. CodeCheck tracers are interactive code simulations that allow students to walk through code snippets, "tracing" and visualizing their execution.
These tracers are built from the [CodeCheck library](https://horstmann.com/codecheck/index.html) and written primarily in Javascript, although the code being traced is written in Python.
These problems are available here in HTML files, they've also been published on CodeCheck through their upload service. A listing can be found in problems.md.
Unfortunately the problem statements are not included here since tracers are published with their problems, but I believe the current set are available on Leetcode under the same names.

This problem set is part of the CTI-Accelerate program, featured in their respective sections on the Canvas course. Since it can be cumbersome to edit the problems from the upload site, I made a repository to make it easier to find all the problems in one location.
The course is free, so it's publicly available here (however I'd still have to ask for a open source license, hence the lack of one. If you would like to use any of these problems for whatever reason, just ask).
